CoreLib is a lightweight, modular development library designed to provide developers with a solid foundation of reusable components, helper functions, and abstractions. Its purpose is to eliminate repetitive code, speed up development, and encourage consistent architecture across projects.

CoreLib is language-agnostic in concept and can be implemented in multiple languages, with the goal of offering a unified and clean structure for everything from utility logic to core systems. Whether you're building a small automation script, a full-stack web application, or a large-scale toolchain, CoreLib gives you a well-organized set of tools to streamline the process.

CoreLib focuses on:

- Clean and readable code patterns
- Common utilities (data manipulation, formatting, validation, etc.)
- Scalable and extensible architecture
- Optional modules that can be used independently or combined
- Easy integration with existing projects

This library is ideal for teams and solo developers who want to enforce a consistent standard across their projects without being locked into a bloated or overly opinionated framework.

Documentation, setup instructions, and examples are provided separately in `instructions.md`.
